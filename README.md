# PRODIGY_DS_TASK1
Overview
This repository contains a Python script that loads a dataset (Data.csv) and generates a histogram visualizing the distribution of years of insurance with a company. The primary purpose is to provide an insightful representation of the distribution of insurance tenure among the dataset.
The script utilizes the pandas library to load data from the 'Data.csv' file, which should contain a column named 'years_of_insurance_with_us.' The primary focus is on generating a histogram using matplotlib, illustrating the frequency distribution of insurance tenure across different intervals. To run the script, users need to ensure Python is installed, install the required libraries using pip install pandas matplotlib, and execute the script via python insurance_years_distribution.py. The resulting histogram will display the distribution of insurance years, with parameters set to 20 bins, a sky-blue color, and black edge coloring. The README provides additional information about the dataset, visualization parameters, and dependencies, offering a comprehensive guide for users interested in exploring and utilizing this code for their own datasets or analyses.
